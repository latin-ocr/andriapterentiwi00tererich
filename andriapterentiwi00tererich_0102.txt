70 ANDRJA. 1. 1. 43-64.

70. viciniae, partitive gen. depending on lma, as osten after ubi,
quo, nusquam, etc. lzzcc viciniam is a needless correction, and lzuz'c
viciniae, given by the MSS„ a good instance of a copyist's blunder.

71. cognatorum neglegentia. This means a good deal in the
mouth of an Athenian. At Athens, if an orphan girl was lest poor, the
next of kin was bound by Solon's law to marry her or to provide a sub-
stantial dowry. Cf. Phor. 125. Cognatas is not used in the technical
Roman sense, but as a translation of the Greek ἀγχιστεύς. The
ἀγχισὲτεύς in this case was Crito, who appears 796. As a citizen of
Andros he was not subject to the Athenian law; so there is no reason
to suppose that it was his legal duty to provide for Chrysis at Andros.
He does not appear to have objected to inheriting anything that she
might have left at her death.

73. ei, interjection, τ- lzcz'.

74. duriter, ‘with hard work.’ Adverbs in —z'tct¹‚ formed from
adjectives in -τις, are common in early Latin, e. g. avarz'ter, αῃιίείίεν,
mundilam later the termination -e became usual, but note humaniter
(as well as humane) and naviter as exceptions.

81. esset, from esse, not from edere, as suggested by the older
commentators.

82. egomet. This omission of a verb of ‘saying’ is common in
Terence. Cf. 336. So Verg. Aen. 1. 37 llaec secum, 3. 99 haec Phoebus.

83. habet.. The regular exclamation over a gladiator who had
received a blow. So hoc habet Plaut. Most. 715, Verg. Aen. 12.
296.

84. venientis aut abeuntis, i. e. on errands to and from the
houses of their respective masters.

88. quid, as in common talk we sometimes begin an explanation
with ‘ why.'

εγωῖῡοωῐηεσυμβολή, called collecta by Cicero, de Or. 2. 57. 2 3 3.
It was the contribution of each individual to the common fund for the
payment of a dinner. So Phor. 339 asymbolas=a person who dines
without being obliged to pay.

90. nil quiequam, ‘nothing whatever,’ an emphatic pleonasni; cf.
Phor. 80, 250, and elsewhere in Terence. It is impossible to suppose,
with Mr. Papillon‚ that quicquam is an adverbia] accusative in these
passages. For though, as he points out, nemo quisquam is not certain
from Eun. 226, the phrase is established by Eun. 1032, Hec. 67.

91. enimvero, ‘of course,' ‘naturally,' used also to express anger or
impatience3 cf. 206. This emphatic use of enim, sometimes at the
beginning of a sentence, is common in Plautus and Terence3 cf. Plaut.
T rin. 1134 enim me nominat. The shortening of the second syllable
