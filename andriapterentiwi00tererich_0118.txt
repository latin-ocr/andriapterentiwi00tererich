86. ANDRIA. 11. 1. 32-2. 10.

sibi, ‘to his credit ; ⁹ dat. commodi.

332. apiscier. The simple verb is probably usual in Plautus and
Terence, though it has often been altered in MSS. (especially the later)
to adipisci. The latter, however, is proved by the metre, Phor. 412.

334. qui. Cf. 6 note. So in the next line qni ne: ut ne.

335. sat habeo, ‘I am satisfiedB Cf. 705, 710.

optume=0pp0rtune. Cf. 686.

336. quiequam,sc. dicis. Cf. 82.

337. nisi ea quae nil opus sunt scire, ‘except the knowledge of
those things which are useless.' Ea is object after scire. Charinus is
referring to Byrria’s commonplace remarks, e. g. 305. Bentley changed
scire (given by all MSS.) into sciri, on the ground that otherwise est
must be read for sunt, and he has been followed by most editors, who,
of course, take scire· as epexegetic of opus sunt, as Bentley did.

fugin hinc, colloquial for the imperative, ‘ be off.’
ego vero ao lubens=eg0 vero fugio ac lztbensfugl'o .· ατε( and
indeed:‘ emphatic. Cf. 370.

ACT ΙΙ. SCENE 2.

Davos informs Charinus and Pamphilus that Simo's announcement
of the marriage is not seriously meant, and describes the observations
which led him to this conclusion.

338. boni, boni. For similar repetitions of a word cf. 947, 958.

Μ’ 340. laetus est nescio quid. Cf. Adel. 79 nescio quid tristem video.

342. audin tu illum. Davos' last words show that he has heard of
the marriage. Therefore Charinus points out that Pamphilus is wrong
in saying nondum haec rescivit mala. s

343. intendam, sc. gradus or iter. camb

344. abeo, given by all MSS„ sor which Donatus has habeo, ‘ I have
it,’ ‘ Ι know,’ z inveni. If habeo is accepted, Davos means that after all

——notu'ithstanding toto me oppido exam‘matzme quaerere--Glycerium's
house is the most likely place.

resiste, ‘ stop?
qui me, sc. revocat or something of the sort.

345. euge. The last syllable is short, Greek εὖγε. It is quite

unnecessary to insert 0 before Charine, for the pause after quaero justifies
the hiatus.

ambo, sc. adestis.

vos volo. Cf. 29.
346. quin audi. Cf. 45 note.
347. quid tu, sc. timeas.
