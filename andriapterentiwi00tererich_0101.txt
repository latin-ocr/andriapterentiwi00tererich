appreciate the joke as the Athenians would. There was no class at
Rome answering to the Sophists.

58. horum, plural, because quod has been expanded in 56, 57.

nil. The accus. of neuter pronouns and adjectives is not uncommon

aster studere ; cf. Haut. 382, Hec. 199. The construction is also used
by Cicero and Livy. Cf. 157 note.

60. non iniuria, ‘ not without cause.’ Cf. 378, Haut. 581.

61. adprime, almost confined to Plautus and Terence, and ¹always

used by them with adjectives. pmw a( m? ssffflsjss

nequid Π1Π115-τμηδὲν ἄγαν, 3 hackneyed Greek proverb. It is
with commonplace reflections of this sort that Sosia, like a chorus,
relieves the garrulity of Simo. Cf. 67, 68, and 142, 143.

62. omnis. Some strangely read omncs (nom.). It is far W .ςὲ

simple to make the subject of all the infinitives the samast-de‘iff
historic infin. Cf. 97, 147, 369. This construction is thoroughly
characteristic of the style of Terence, who in this respect is, as Spengel
remarks, the Sallust of early Latin. It will be noticed that he even
uses the historic infin. eo-ordinate with a finite verb. If the words
advorsus—illis below were considered to be an interpolation, it would
be possible to regard the infinitives as in apposition to vila.

63. quibus—quomque. Tmesis. Cf. 263, 455, 486.

sese dedere, ‘ comply with the wishes of.’ Cf. 897.

64. ffirum, dissyllable. The arrangement of the first three words
is rather uncertain; and some have suspected that advorsus—illis is an
interpolation. Bentley has subjected the words to an unsparing criti-
cism‚ and it must be admitted that the passage does not run very well.
But it is quite in the character of Simo to enforce his point by the
addition of a couple of participial clauses, in which he lingers on the
merits of his son. At any rate they sound natural enough on the
stage. Spengel, adding esse to advorsus turns it into an infin. co-
ordinate with obsequi, etc.; but there is nt? gr mmatic l difficulty in the
text. M

65. illis. Bentley's correction aliis is unnecessary. The plural
notion is already contained in nemini.

ita—:quod sz' facias. The MSS. give ita ut, which seems very
awkward. Ut probably was introduced on the false analogy of such
passages as 80 ila ut fit.

66. invenias, Cf. 571.

68. This line is quoted by Cicero, de Am. ξ 89, 35 3 general senti-
ment without the qualifying words lzoc tempore.

69. mulier quaedam, Chrysis, named in 105.

abhine. Cf. 22 note.
