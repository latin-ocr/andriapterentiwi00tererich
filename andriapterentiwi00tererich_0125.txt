11. 6.11—III. 1. 7- NOTES. LJNES 422-465. 93

442. via, ‘aright‚' a remembrance of Simo's ironical request (190)
that Pamphilus iam redeat in viam. Recta, which has‘ got into the
MSS. against the metre, must be a gloss on via, due to some one who
did not see that the word has much more point without the adjective.

443. ei, a spondee‚ as Haut. 455 and always in Lucretius.

dumque aetas tulit. Cf. 188.

445. fortem, of char ter ‘e timable.' Cf. Phor. 324 O vn soalz's
at ue amzczts.

{46- animum adpulit. Cf 1 note. ffAEd mffmm?

448. quod, accus. of respect or limitation. f. 376.

449 quin dio, quid est. Cf. 45 note.

451. dra-chumis. The old form from δραχμή was draclmma, as
Alcumena from Ἀλκμήνη, etc. PQWQC*

obsonatum, passive impersonal, but perhaps obsonatus froin
deponent obsonari ought to be read.

454. quod dicendum hio siet, ‘as far as one in my place may
speak: ' lzic, ‘ by me to you,’ though it may=‘ between ourselves,’ i. e.
in the absence of Pamphilus: siet, cf. 234. The subjunctive is here
used in the relative clause to express ‘limitation.’ Cf. Mad. ξ 364, Obs.
2, and such expressions as quod sciam, quod meminerim.

455. quoque, ‘in fact3' for the meaning is not, ‘ You like others are
stingy,’ but, ‘it is true, as well as declared by Pamphilus, that you are
stingy’

per parce nimium. Tmesis for pcrni'mzum parce. Cf 486.
It 1s possible, however, that we should read perpet} ce
non laudo. A comic repetition of Simo s laudo ln 44 3.
457. rei, monosyllable here and in the next line.
veterator, ‘ old rascal!

ACT ΙΙΙ. SCENE 1.

Simo overhears a conversation about Glycerium and her child. Hc

459. pol, a common abbreviation for edepol.

460. invenias, potential subjunctive. Cf. 53, 135, etc.

465. actumst, ‘it is all over‚' an expression used originally in the law-
courts of a case already concluded. So Phor. 419 ‘ actum‚' aiunt, ‘ne
agas.’
