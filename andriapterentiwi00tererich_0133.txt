Aci* ΙΙΙ. SCENE 5.

Pamphilus has just heard from Simo that Chremes has consented to
his daughter's marriage. He comes on boiling with rage against Davos
by whose advice this catastrophe has been brought about, and is only
prevented from taking summary vengeance on the slave by the pressing
necessity of his own position.

607. scelus qu‘i. Cf. 250. The reading of this line is very doubt-
ful. The MSS. read qui me perdidit, or qui me lzodz'e perdidit. Neither
reading will scan. Hodie was probably supplied from 620, and perdidit
would be the natural gloss on the aposiopesis quz’ me . . . On the stage
the sense would be completed by a gesture.

608. nulli, for nullius. Pronouns forming the gen. and dat. in
-z'us and -z' are occasionally declined by Terence like a regular ad-
jective in ·us -a -ic722; cf. alterae dat. fem. infra 983, Phorm. 928,
Haut. 271, Eun. 1004 milei solae. Nulli consili is read also Cic.
Rosc. 16 548.

609. me commisisse. Cf 245.

futtffi, [deriv. fundo, cf. funs, a water- vessel]‚ lit. ‘that which
cannot containss thence‘ worthless.' ΜΛ)

610. pretium ob stultitiam :pretmm stultitme. Cf. 138.

612. Cf. 252.

modo. Cf. 594 note.

613. ducere. For this use of the present for future inf. see 379,

note.

audeam, deliberative subjunctive. Notice the near connexion of
meaning between the future simple negabo and the present subjunctive
audeam. ’

614. quid me faciam, ‘what Ι shall do with myself.’ Facere, fieri,
esse, in the sense of ‘to do anything with a person‚’ ‘ anything to be
done with or happen to a person,’ are constructed with the ablative or
dative without a preposstion, or rarely with de and the ablative.
