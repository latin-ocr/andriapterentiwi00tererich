T u quoque, tu in summis, O dimidz‘ate Menander,
Ponerz's et merite, puri sermonis amator.

Lenibus atque utinam scriptis adiuncta} soret vis
Canaba, ut aequato virtus polleret honore

C um Graecis, neque z‘n hac despectus parte iaceres,-
Unum laec maceror ac doleo tibi deesse, Terenti.

Not that Terence was devoid of humour ; but his humour is so
delicate and refined that it must often have fallen flat upon the
stage. WVhen his plays are well known their subtle satire and
polished wit can be appreciated ; but there is without doubt an
absence of energy and action (Caesar’s vis comica), which
prevented his pieces from being dramatically successful. An
audience must be educated up to his plays before it can perceive
their many excellences.
