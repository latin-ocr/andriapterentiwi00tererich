xxii INTRODUCTION.

trochaic line, containing four metres or eight feet. In the other
lines, however, i. e. bacchiac, dactylic, and cretic, each separate
foot is called a metre. Again, some lines have a number of
complete feet3 these are called acatalecti03 while others are
called catalectiC, because the last foot is incomplete. Thus a
trochaic tetrameter catalectic is a trochaic line of four metres or

eight feet, wanting the last syllable, and really containing only
seven feet and a half.

Ι. IAMBIC.

(a) Iambie Tetrameter Acataleetio, called Oetonarius
from its eight complete feet. (Common.)

(b) Iambie 'Petrameter Cataleetic, called septenarius,
from its seven complete feet. (Less common.)

(c) Iambic Trimeter Aeataleetie, or Senarius. (Very

»- common3 all the plays of Terence begin with it.)

(d) Iambie Dimeter Aeatalectio, or Quaternarius. (Used
occasionally.)

(e) Iambie Dimeter Cataleetio. (Rare: in 485.)

These lines consist in their pure form of iambi ; but the
spondee, tribrach‚ anapaest, and dactyl are admitted in all feet
except the last, which must be an iambus, unless, of course, the
verse is catalectic. Moreover, as the Tetrameter is regarded as
being composed of two verses, with the division after the fourth
foot, that foot is usually an iambus 3 and such words as ego, tibi,
cedo (ef. 702, 703, 705), are allowed to stand there as if at the
end of a senarius.

ΙΙ. TROCHAIC.

(a) 'I'roehaie Tetrameter Aoatalectic‚ or octonarius.
(Not common.)

(b>¹1·rochaic Tetrameter Cataleetic‚ or septenarius.
(Very common.)

(c) Troe-haio Dimeter Cataleotie. (246, 517.)
