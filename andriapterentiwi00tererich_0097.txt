2 3. dicere. Possibly here and in 535 nubere we ought to scan the
last syllable long, the old termination being -rez‘; but it seems that all
undoubted instances of this lengthening (of which 437 dicere isto be noted)
occur when the word is followed by a strong pause. In 535 there is no
pause- at all aster nubere, and no strong pause here. More probably we
should scan maledi Ῐ cere' ma Ι lefacta; and so 267 Pam Ι phile quid Ι .

relicuom. This word is always of four syllables in the older
writers; relicuos in Lucr. 1. 560 (cf. Munro's note). Catullus, Tibullus,
Vergil, and Horace, unwilling either to lengthen the first syllable or
unite the two last, avoid the word altogether. Later it is used as a tri-
syllable, e. g. by Juvenal.

Ac I. SCENE 1.

Simo tells his freedman Sosia of the early life and disposition of his
son Pamphilus ; of thelove of the latter for Glycerium, and its accidental
discovery; of the consequent refusal of Chremes to allow his daughter
Philumena to marry Pamphilus; finally, of his (Simo’s) pretence that
the match is never-theless to take place, in order that he may test the
obedience of hi's son.

Thus Terence, following his ordinary practice, uses the first scene to
give us such information about the position of affairs as enables us to
understand the action of the play.
