METRES AND PROSODY. XXV

probably suffer elision of both vowels, though we may elide the
last only, and scan ῑῖχονεηι, ἔπε’, as already explained.

ΙΙ. Retention of the quantity of final vowels originally
long. This is much less common in Terence than in Plautus.
Many instances given by Wagner are not certain. Probably
this retention takes place only when it is helped by a pause,
e. g. 437 potin es mi verum dz‘cere‘.

ΙΙΙ. Synizesis. Most dissyllabic words, in which no con-
sonant separates the vowels, may be treated as monosyllables ;
e. g. 95 scias, 843 meo, 296 tuae, 880 szcz', 210 lucius, 93, 210 eius,
765 qzc0i2c53 and so ἒὸνιιηι, me-o‘rum, etc. ; ἕναηιίΐῑὶπτιία (814) is
noticeable, if it is the right reading 3 dehinc and proin are always
monosyllabic in Terence. In 202 circuitione seems to scan as

cz’rcz‘lz'one, cu apparently being regarded as r- qu.

Hiatus is admitted :

(1) When there is a change of speaker, e. g. 616, 665.

(2) WVhen a line is broken by a strong pause, e.g. 345.

(3) When a word is isolated by the sense, e. g. 264 incertum.
(4) After the fourth foot of an Iambic or Trochaic Tetrameter..

It is hardly necessary to note that the interjection O is not

elided before vowels‚ e.g, 769, 817 ; nor is em, cf. 604.
Occasionally a long vowel is shortened instead of being elided,

e. g. 191 qui amant. Cf. Verg. Ecl. 8. 108 an qui‘ amant.
