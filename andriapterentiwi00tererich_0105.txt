1.1.110-121. NOTES. LINE5113—148. 73

cito, and Haut. 1023 sed ipse egreditur, quam severus. Sometimes we
find quam strengthened by an ‘adverb prefixed; e. g. mire quam, sane
quam. Cf. θαυμαστῶς ὡς. The phrase can hardly be explained as=
quam potuit familiariter, for this use of quam and the positive adjective
or adverb is hardly found till after the Augustine period. Cf„ however,
Caes. Β. G. 6. 26 rami quam late dffmdzmz‘ur.

137. quid ais. These words occur very often in Terence. They
are used (1) as a request for information, when a remark has not been
sully heard, cf. 184, · (2) as an exclamation of surprise, when a remark
has been hear‚d but seems scarcely credible, as here, cf. 301, 588, 9333
(3) to introduce a new point in conversation, or to call any one’s
attention, like‘ dis donc? cf. 517, 575.

aegre ferens, without object expressed, as Adel. 143 ae<⁵ σνε pate„

138. ad obiurgandum causae, cf. 1· 5ο. Equivalent to the more
regular obzurgandz' causa, which we have 1n 158.

139. quid commerui, ‘what fault have Ι committed?' We may

say that quui: quam noxzanTffiffi-[Trin. 28), or quam culpam (Phor.

206), or quzd malz (Plaut Aul 728) Commerere is used re ularly m a

bad, as pmme? ere in a good sense. pssstzccaas-‹s'y -3

141. honesta oratiost‚ ‘it is a fair 'yffi We&-

143. Fleckeisen is surely wrong (followed by? Spenge and Meissner)
in altering dederet of the MSS. to dedzt. The indic. tulit is necessary,
because it refers to a definite act in past time; but qui dederit damnum

has only a hy pothetical existence.
dederit damnum aut, malum, &md dgfflge Μέῖῗῖἕέῗ

Cf. Plaut. Trin. 219 cum damno ct malo, where damno=‘s1ne,’ injury to
property, mal0=‘ punishment,' injury to person. Damnum is a passive
partic. of dare, as alumnus, etc.; but the repetition of the verb 1s merely

accidental.
145. The cofgr‘i‘sstssfffissc‘effaster facinus or comperi.ssf‚7 In the

former case zndzgnL 111 facmus is an exclamation standing alone, as Adel.
173. The ον. vecta would be indzffizmn facinus, Simo! comperi Pam-
plczlum, etc.

147. instat saetam, (sc. esse), ‘he insists that it is the ase This
construction occurs Plaut. Mer.c 242, and perhaps nowhere else.
Though uneommon, it does not seem odd. Cicero, too, has acc. and
infin. after the similar verb urgere.

148. qui, indefinite3 cf. 6 note. It is grammatically possible to take
qui as nom. masc. here, but many other passages make the construction
certain. The word would generally disappear in translation into English,
e.g. ‘we part on such terms that he declines to consent to his daughter's
marriage.'
