Ι.5.9-26. NOTES. LINES 236-261. 81

244. si fit, pereo, a graphic variety for sifiet‚ peribo.
²45· ‘ Can any man be so hapless in love or so unfortunate as Ι am ?’ f

This use of the acc. and infin. in indignant exclamations (mostly intro· W 27!ae

duced by the interrogative -ne) is very common. Surprise at the exist-
ence of some state of things is combined with a question whether such
can really be the case. Cf. 253, 425, 609, 689, 870, 879.

invenustus εάναφρόδιτος. Join adeo ut ego sum. Cf. 162 note.

247. Chremetis. Like some other Greek proper names this word
follows more than one form of inflexion. Cf. Chremetem 472, 533,
Chremeti Phor. 10263 but Chremi (genitive) 368, Chremem 361, 527.
As for the vocative, there is plenty of MSS. authority both for Chremes
and Chreme.

248. quot modis. We do not hear of any attempts on the part of
Simo to induce Chremes to give his consent, after the match was once
broken off. The reference probably is to a number of strong expressions
used by Chremes, which would lose nothing in transmission through
Simo to Pamphilus.

facta transacta, ⁶ settled and concluded,' i. e. the match was·
definitely ‘ off.’ For the asyndeton in this line cf. 304, 373. “

249. nisi si, like quasi si, εἰ μὴ εἰ, πλὴν ἐάν, the hypothetical force of
the first word being forgotten. Cf. Adel. 594, Plaut. Trin. 474.

250. aliquid monstri. Cf. 2 note, id negoti. ΫᾸΕΜΑἻ W

alunt, like a beast. Cf. 57. (J
ea, gender accommodated to sense. Cf. 607.

2 52. nam. The connexion seems to be : ‘ Ι try to explain the conduct

of Chremes ; for how can I explain that of my father? ’

Ι 253. Cf. 245 note.

2 54. apud forum: in foro, as often in Plautus and Terence. Cf. 302,
745·

para, absolute. φεῦ rsa-ou!

257. causam, ‘ excuse.

2 58-9. ‘ Now if any one asked me, what Ι should have done if Ι had
been forewarned of it, (Ι should answer), Ι would have done something
to escape from doing this.’ The apodosis to si quis roget must be
supplied; the primary tense is used because the supposition is possible.
On the other hand, sz' rescissem facerem contains an impossible
hypothesis.

ut, ne=ne, as often. Cf. 699, and 335 qui ne.
quod si, not found in Plautus, rare in Terence, common later. Cf.
604. Quod is properly an accusative of limitation3 cf. 289.

261. huius, ‘ for her,’ i. e. Glycerium ; objective, as patris in the next
line.
