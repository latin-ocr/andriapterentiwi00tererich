Vi PREFA CE.

We have made constant use of the editions of Umpfenbach,
Fleckeisen, R. Klotz, A. Spengel, Meissner, and Wagner,—
the first two on textual questions only,—and have occa-
sionally referred to those of Bentley, Zeune (containing the
commentaries of Donatus), Stallbaum, Parry, and Papillon.
