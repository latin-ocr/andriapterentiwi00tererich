⁴ was known merely from the private rehearsal before the Curule Aediles.

This view receives strong confirmation, if we can accept the story told
by Suetonius of the recitation before the poet Caecilius; sor which see
Introduction.

The prologues to the plays of Terence differ from those to the plays
of Plautus in several points: (1) Terence's prologues are genuine, while
nearly, if not quite, all of Plautus’ prologues are spurious; (2) of the
prologues of Plautus (twelve in number, if we count the two remaining
lines belonging to the Pseudulus), nine contain an analysis of the plot,
which Terence thought unnecessary ; (3) Terence never mentions him-
self by name; we find the name of Plautus in the prologues to the
Trinummus‚ Asinaria, Pseudulus.

1. Poeta, used by Terence in all his prologues instead of his own name.
quom. Always in Plautus and Terence. The Latin writers till
the end of the republican period regularly avoided a u after u or v. So
we have parvolo in 35, relicuom in 25 (see note). The correct form in
Cicero is curn.
animum adpulit, cf. 446. Α dpellere commonly means ‘ to bring to
land,' and Cicero gives the metaphor fully, de Orat. 2. 154 tamquam acl
aliquem libidinis scopulum, sic luam mentem acl philosophiam aclpulisti.
The expression z ‘ se conserre‚' ‘ to devote oneself to.’

2. id negoti, ‘ this simple task ;' cf. 521. The expression is of more
limited meaning than id negotium, since the genitive is partitive. Terence
often has similar phrases in a comit: sense,just as diminutives are used ;
eg. Haut. 848 quid hominis cs ? negoti. This form of the genitive of
substantives in -im, -2'um is universal in all writers, till the elegiae poets
Ovid and Propertius introduced -ii; finding, of course, such forms as
imperi, etc. unmanageable. So 44 benefeci. Adjectives in -izts, how-
ever, do not contract the genitive.

3. fabulas, instead of fabulae, by attraction. Cf. 26, 47. This
attraction of a substantive into the case of the relative is common in
Plautus also, and found in Vergil, Horace, Ovid.

fecisset bears the same relation to credidit that the fut. perf.
would to a primary tense.

4. multo, with aliter.

intellegit. Note the e in this and one other compound of lego,
m’glego.

5. prologis, in spite of πρόλογος, would seem natural to a Latin ear,
accustomed to such compounds as proloqui. So too pmipinare and Gr.
προπίνειν.

scribundis. This was the archaie form of the gerundive. At the
