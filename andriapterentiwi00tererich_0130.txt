98 ANDRJA. 111. 3. 4-33.

535. viso, ‘ Ι come to see.’

id is explained by the words tune an illc· insaniant, and would
not be translated by a separate word.

536. paucis. Cf. 29.

quid . . . velim et, quod . . . quaeris. For this change of con-
struction see 273 note, 650.

538. per te deos. Cf. 834. In this sense per is often separated
from its object.

Chreme, cf. 247 note.

541. quoius is scanned as one syllable.

543. ne . . . obsecra. Donatus notes this construction, in place of
ne with the subjunctive, as a Graecism; a direct translation of μὴ

546. in rem, ‘to the advantage ;' cf. Pl. Trin. 628, 748, Capt. 398.
In the same sense ex re Pl. Ps. 338. Ob rem is found=⁶ with advan-

vantage,’ Pl. Trin. 2 38.

557. eius, scanned as one syllable; cf. 541.

558. harum, sc. Glycerium, Mysis, Archilis.

559. redducunt. The ind. probably indicates Simo's conviction
that Pamphilus will, otherwise, relent. The spelling is confirmed by
Lucretius, who lengthens the first syllable, and appears as a correc-
tion in A.

animum aegrotum. Cf. 193.

560. consuetudine. This word is specially used of lovers' relations
to each other; cf. 110, 279, 439. ⁶ antam(

Glycerium.

sese emersurum, ‘ will extricate himselfi’ Emmgrere is occasion-
ally used in a transitive sense3 cf. Nep. Att. Ι 1. 1 quibus ex malis ut sc
emersit. The perf. part. is used by Cicero, Livy, Ovid, and Tacitus in
a middle sense, e. g. Cic. Div. 2. 68 tila· subito sum visus emersus e
flumine. The verb is found in its ordinary sense Eun. 555.

563—4. The compressed style os these lines causes some obscurity.
After posse must be understood se emergere, and posse must be supplied
both before habere and perpeti. In 564, illum, sc. Pamphilus, is the
subject, hane, sc. Philumena, is the object. Translate, ‘but I do not
think that he can extricate himself, nor that he can be always faithful to
her (sc. my daughter), nor that 1 can endure it' (se. his unfaithfulness).
