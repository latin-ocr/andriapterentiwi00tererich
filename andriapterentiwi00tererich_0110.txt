205. neque tu hoe dices, etc., ‘ nor shall you say that you were not
warned of this,’ i. e. I speak so plainly, that you cannot mistake me.
Hoc, given by the MSS„ is altered by the editors into haud on the
authority of Donatus, neque haud being understood like the Greek
double negative. But (Ι) lzoc gives a perfectly good sense, (2) Terence
has no other instance of neque haud, though it is true that Plautus has.
(3) Donatus says, ‘tres negativae [i.e. neque, lzaua', non] pro una negativa
ac·cipz‘2mtur‚’ which clearly shows that he considered neque and haud
not as strengthening, but as destroying each other; and that he objected
to hoc because he thought a third negative necessary to the sense of the
passage ; in which view he will not find many followerS.

ACT Ι. SCENE 3.

Davos, alone on the stage, reflects on the difficulties of the situation.

206. enimver03 cf. 91 note. Here, stas there, it introduces a
statement with emphasis. §Q thsshs

208. providentur, ‘preventedt’ proz‘iz'dere in this sense is regularly

&Mbfflaeefollowed by the accusative, and it is impossible to understand why some
editors explain quae providentur as irregular for quibus providetur,
which would mean the exact opposite.

210. eius, like illum, refers to Pamphilus : cius and huius are mono-
syllables

212. nequam faciam, etc„ ‘lest Ι should use any intrigue to defeat
this intended match.'

213, 214. A passage of great difficulty. It seems best to explain the
construction as follows z—sz' senserit aut causam ceperit is protasis; quo
—dabz‘t is apodosis; perii is merely a parenthetical exclamation, not con-
nected with the construction of the sentence ; sz' lubitum fuerit is a subor—
dinate protasis, qualifying causam, equal in sense to quam lubitum fuerit
(capere). Bentley goes so far as to read quam instead of sz'. Translate,
‘ If he actually detects me, (ruin Ξ) or even finds a pretext satisfactory to
himself, rightly or wrongly he will hurry me off to the mill.’ The
remaining difficulty belongs to quo iure quaque iniuria, which is
equivalent in sense to καὶ δικαίως κάδίκως (Aristoph. Plut. 233) ; but it
seems hopeless to attempt any explanation of the relatives as the passage
stands, unless Terence supposed himself to be translating ὡς δικαίως
κάδίκως or something of the sort. Bentley's emendation qua iure qua
me iniuria, (qua—quazcum—tum as elsewhere), is at any rate
translateable. It is usual to take perii and -ceperit as apodosis, and
quo—dabit as a relative clause, ‘ if he detects ine, periz'; if he takes the
fancy, he will find a reason for sending me to the mill;' a rendering
objectionable (among other reasons> because it contrasts ‘pert‘slzing‘
