1. 2. 19-33· NOTES. LINES 178-204. 77

19 1. hoc quid sit ἓ) ‘ What is the point of all this?' Davos pretends not
to understand how he is concerned with the conduct of Pamphilus. Simo
proceeds to make it quite clear. The subjunctive must depend on an ellipse
of some word like quaero. This construction is more common when one
speaker quotes a question first asked by the other ; e. g. 499, Adel. 84
quidfccz‘t? to which Demea replies quid illefeccrit? (sc. quaeris). Ac-
cordingly some editors assign lzoc quid sit to Simo. However, Davos
has not asked, as he ought, lzoc quid est? but he may have looked it.

qui amant, i. e. in love with some one other than the proposed uxor.

193. ‘Too often he guides his heart, love—sick already, towards the
worse object? Cf. 924 se adplicat, a common phrase.

ipsum aegrotum must be taken together ; =⁶ love-sick without
the promptings of the magister?

195. sane, a colloquial word for ‘yes,' like etiam.

199. verberibus, etc„ ‘ I will flog you, Davos, within an inch of your
life, and set you in the mill! Usque ad = ‘ right up to but, not including.'
Cf. Adel. 90 mulcavit usque ad mortem. Notwithstanding the order of
the words, it seems best to take usque ad necem after caesum, not (as
Spengel) after dedam. There are two threats ; verberibus caesum
strengthened by usque ad necem, and z'n pistrinum dedam strengthened
by ca lege, ete. W q

200. ea lege atque omine, ‘ on the condition and solemn assflsfr'ance boumn
that? There is no parallel to this use of omen; but, as Mr. Papillon
says, the idea of ⁶ prognostic ’ may pass into that of ‘warning’

201. nondum etiam, an emphatic pleonasm‚ as etiam with a nega-
tive = nondum. Cf. 116 note.

callide = plane. We say, ‘ Ι shrewdly suspect.' w‘nff l fgf
202. locutus possibly ought to be written locutu’s= locutu es.
circuitione, five syllables, not six. As cz'rcuz'ui (Phor. 614) is
s our syllables, not three, and so circuimus, circuit, circuis used by
Plautus, some editors write circum z'tz'one separately, so that the last
syllable of circum may be elided. But this separation seems scarcely
natural, and cz'rcuz'lz'o might be pronounced cz‘rcz’tz'o.

203. passus sim. This potential subjunctive (cf. Mad. ξ 350 b, 135
note) is often used to express in a cautious way what will happen if
certain circumstances arise. The perfect tense is usual, as here:
‘I would sooner be deceived.’ Cf. phrases like haud facile dixerim,
‘1 shall find it difficult to say.’

deludier, archaic form of infin. pass„ used also by poets generally.

204. bona verba, quaese, ‘hush‚ hush,' εεύφήμει ; cf. favete linguis.

Davos pretends to be shocked to hear such an ill-omened word as
deludicr applied to his master.
