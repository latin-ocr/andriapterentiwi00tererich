the Laws of the Twelve Tables, the F escennine verses became
merely a generic name for improvised songs, not always very
refined, at weddings, triumphs, or other festal occasions.

Saturae. According to Livy 7. 2, the first ‘ludi scenici'
were introduced at Rome 361 Β. C. to appease the anger of the
gods who had sent a pestilence on the city.

It seems certain that about.this time a stage was erected in
the Circus at the Ludi Maximi, and the first three days of the
festival were henceforth occupied with recitations‚ music, and
dancing. Performers from Etruria, called ludiones, danced to
the music of the flute without words or descriptive action ; but
the strolling minstrels of Latium (grassatores, spatiatores) soon
took advantage of the stage to recite their chants with appropriate

music and gesture. These performances were named from ”

their miscellaneous character Saturae ¹. They were composed
in the rugged Saturnian metre‚ with no connected plot, and did
not admit of dialogue.

Fabulae Atellanae. A nearer approach to dramatic form
was made in the Fabulae Atellanae, broad farces with stock
characters, e. g. Maccus, Pappus, Bucco, and Dossenus,
analogous to the clown‚ pantaloon, and harlequin of an English
pantomime. Each character had its traditional mask, and the
pieces were originally played only by amateurs at private
theatricals; but when translations from Greek dramas had
monopolised the Roman stage, the Atellan farce was adopted

cellanies, with which we are familiar from the works of Horace, Juvenal,
and Persius, were introduced by Lucilius, who died 103 B.C. Cf. Hor.
