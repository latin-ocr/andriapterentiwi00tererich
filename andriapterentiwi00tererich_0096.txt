64 ANDRJA.

10. To know onc is to know both from their general similarity of plot.

11. non ita, ⁶ not very,’ a common phrase. The text perhaps gives
the best arrangement of a somewhat doubtful line.

12. oratione ae stilo, ‘execution and form.' Argumentum means
the material of the plot, orati the manner in which it is worked out,

stilus the form of the language.ple‚Ll}lZsbt=the word ‘ scriptura ’ Phor.

13. quae convenere, ‘ all that he found suitable.’

in Andriam, of course with transtulisse.

14. fatetur. Bentley has a characteristic note: ⁶ Quis fatetur? an
Menander? Is enim nominativus z'n proximo est. Adde igitur infino
versus, cx Perinthia llic. It is true that Terence constantly refers to
himself in the prologue as lzz‘c, e. g. 193 but the subject of fatetur is
quite clear without it. Bentley for the same reason alters antehac into
ante lzz'c Phor. prol. 4.

transtulisse. The omission of se and other pronouns before the
infin. is frequent in Terence, e. g. 145, 358, 394, 401, 470, etc.

15. isti, i. e. the critics.

disputant, ‘maintain‚’ a rare use of the word followed by acc.
and infin.

in eo, ‘ the1·ein‚’ ‘in doing so ;' the words are best explained by
referring them to vituperant, as in 94 in ea re refers to corfiz'ctatur of the
preceding line. Latin writers generally use in ea ro, eius roi, etc„

instead of the ambiguous 2⁸12 eo, etc. ¹
16. contaminari, lit. ‘ to bring‘lssig'fgfi act’ (for contagmz'naro,

same stem as tango). This verb (but not the substantive contami-
natio) is used here and in Haut. prol. 17 in the sense of amal-
gamating two plays into one. Later it always means, ‘to stain‚' ‘to
mar,‘ and thus is found Eun. 552. The charge of ‘contaminating'
is mentioned by Terence and admitted to be true in this pro-
logue and in those to the Eunuchus and Adelphi3 the latter is
peculiar, because the originals‚ from which it is taken, are by different
poets, viz. Menander and Diphilus. The charge is also admitted in
the prologue to Hauton Timorumenos; though Terence tells us that that
play. however, is ex integra Graeca integram comoediam.

17. ‘Is not the result of all their wisdom, that they are wise in
nothing?' An instance of oxymoron, such as is common in Greek;
e. g. Menander's φρονῶν οὐδὲν φρονεῖ.

ne, as often in the older Latin, for nonne, which is little used by .

Plautus and Terence. Cf. 238 note.

they are put in chronological order. The poet probably means that he
