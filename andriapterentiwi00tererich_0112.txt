ACT Ι. SCENE 5.

Pamphilus complains bitterly of the attempts made by Simo and
Chremes to force a wife upon him, protests that he will never leave
Glycerium, and describes how Chrysis on her death—bed committed her
to his charge. Mysis remains in the background till 267.

The mixture of iambic and trochaic lines in this scene suits well the
expression of strong feeling.

236. hocinest, etc, ‘Is this the aet or purpose of a human being?
is this the duty of a father?’ The argument is, ‘if any one of human
feeling cannot do this, how absurd to say that a father ought to do it l ’
If -ne is added to lzz‘ce, haece, hoco, the final e in these words is changed
into τ’. For factum and inceptmlz some read factu and inceptu. It
seems to be a matter of speculation; in such a case MSS. do not help
us much, as the final m is indicated merely by a mark over the u.

nonne. It is doubtful whether we ought not to read non here
and in the next line. Plautus and Terence ordinarily use -ne or non
instead of nonne. Cf. 17 note.

Of oportuit Donatus says quam de stomacho repetitum est.

242. suam uxorem. We may scan suam as a monosyllable and
elide both vowels, or, considering it as a dissyllabIe, shorten the first
syllable of uxorem.

id, ‘his purpose?

inmutatum. If this word is the pass. participle of inmutare
(cf. 275), it must mean ‘ changed,' as in has no negative force in com-
position with verbs. Spengel takes it thus, explaining that Pamphilus‘
grief at the idea of marriage had changed into joy when he found that
Chremes refused to allow the match. It is much better to consider it as
an adjective, ‘unchanged’ The remark is intelligible enough, though
not quite logical. Pamphilus, contrasting the changed purpose of
Chremes with his own unchangcablc fidelity. speaks as if the one were
the consequence of the other.
