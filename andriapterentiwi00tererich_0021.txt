ROMAN COMEDY AND TERENCE. XVii

the easy yet pointed dialogue, the terse and dramatic descrip-
tions, and the admirable delicacy of the portrayal of character,
won for Terence from the cultured taste of the Augustan age a
more favourable verdict¹ than he could have expected from the
rude and unlettered masses who most enjoyed the broad fun of
a boisterous farce. The above characteristics secured for
Terence considerable attention at the Renaissance in Europe.
In England several of the minor dramatists are under obliga-
tions to him, while in France his influence profoundly affected
Moliere, and is in no small degree responsible for the long-
continued servitude of the French drama to the ‘unities’ of
time and place which have so cramped its free development.
The Andria has been adapted to the French stage by Baron as
L’Andrz'enne, while Sir Richard Steele has presented it in an
English dress as T lze Conscious Lovers.

As might be expected, the characters in Terence, though
admirably drawn, are rather commonplace. No personality in
his plays stands out in the memory like that of Tyndarus in
the Captivi, or Stasimus in the T rz'mcmmzcs. His morality
does not rise above a conventional respectability and a civilised
consideration for others, except where the natural impulses
inspire a generous disposition with something of nobility.

The discerning criticism of Caesar nearly expresses the more
matured judgment of modern times z

¹ Afranius writes:
Terentio non similem dices quempiam.
Cicero writes:
Tu quoque, qui solus lecto sermone, Terenti,

Conversum expressumque Latina voce Menandrmn
In medium nobis sedatis vocibus effirs,
Quidquid come loquens atque omnia dulcia dicens.
Horace, Ep. 2. 1. 59, records the general verdict:
dicitur. . .
Vincere Caecilius gravitate, Terentius arte.

Volcatius, on the other hand, places Terence below Naevius, Plautus,
Caecilius, Licinius, and Atilius.
