Ac'r ΙΙ. SCENE 1.

Charinus, who is in love with Philumena, daughter of Chremes, hears
from his slave Byrria of her proposed marriage with Pamphilus. The
latter, being entreated by Charinus to postpone the match, professes
the greatest readiness to do so.

301. quid ais. An expression of surprise3 ef. 137. It is provoked
by some words spoken by Byrria before the opening of the scene. We

probable. Cf. Chaereci Eun. 558.

310. hie: ego, like Greek ὅδε ἀνήρ. Cf. 890, Plaut. Trin. 1115. He
says it δεικτικῶς, with a gesture, pointing at himself.

si sis, sentias. The use of the pres. subj. has the rhetorical effect
of representing the supposition as possible. Cf. 914, Mad. ξ 347 obs.
