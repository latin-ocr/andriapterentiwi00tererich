‘ constant forbearance,’ a form of expression very common in Greek, and
not unknown in Latin3 cf. Plaut. Pers. 385 non tu nunc hominum
mores vides, where the construction seems certain. Further examples
might be given, in Cicero, Livy, and Vergil, as well as Plautus and
Terence; but as there is no definite article to bind the phrase together,
a different construction is almost always possible. In this passage the
›L- ἲ sense points to semper verebar. Davos was frightened by a special dis-
’λῖ-ίῖἔῖ play of lenitas on a particular occasion, because he thought it to have
been assumed by Simo in order to provoke no suspicion of his real inten-

as constantly characteristic of his father; but the experiences of son and

slave may have been a little different.
