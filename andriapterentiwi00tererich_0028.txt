I. Shortening of syllables usually regarded as long.

1. Shortening of vowels naturally long. This takes place
with the final vowel of dissyllabic words:

(a) When the first syllable is short and accented 3 common in
the case of imperatives 3 e. g. 300 cdvess and 50 some scan 255
cibi. Wagner expresses this in a formula, ύ — Ξόυ.

(b) Before a long accented syllable, so that υ —-'-=..‚ υ-Ι. ; e. g.
403 aava? te e‘sse, 682 mozeneu co'ncrepzcit, 760 caveu qzto'qzcam.

2. Shortening of syllables long by position τ

(a) By dropping or slurring final consonants.
772, 91 enim vero, 503 certo enim scio.
s, 262 patris pudor, 308 magis lubido, 412 erzls me, 651
mezls carnzlsex, 673 sati‘s credo.
r, 261 achr misericordia, 301 dazt27r7ze illa.
t, 396 dabit nemo.
d, 302, 745 apeldforum, and perhaps 408 αριἳιί te ut.
n, 271 egdn propter, 399 z‘tdn credis, 504 egb‘n te, 749 satin
scmus, 803 z’tdn Chrysis.
So, too, l, x, and even nt. Monosyllables are very commonly
shortened, e. g. 42 id gratum, 237 quid &st sz· haec, 462 sed liic
Pamphilus, 480 ego in portu, 708 ego licinc visam.

(b) By indifference to double consonants, which Terence
probably did not write. Thus ille is often used as a pyrrhic,
and the first syllable of omnis is scanned short (694) 3 for mn:
ηπ in pronunciation. So 378 ipSZts sibi isse.

(c) By weakening consonants of unaccented syllables, when
an accented syllable immediately precedes, eg. 225 quidem
liffrcle, or immediately follows, e. g. 66 sine invidia, 466 bonum
fngdm'um, 614 quidem aitque id ago, 830 a‘tqzce in ince'rtczs, 944
υοίῑῖρίάίί. The first syllable of iste and ipse is often short;
cf. 174, 645. Note that in 242, 510, 781 suam, tuam, eam
