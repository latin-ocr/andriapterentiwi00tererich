82 ANDRIA. I. 5. 28·42.

nuptiarum, with the daughter of Chremes.
263. quae-quomque, Cf. 63 note.

§Ine ego ub advorser ἕ) ⁵ can I oppose him ? ’ Note the
emphatic position of ei. Mad. (ξ 353 obs.) explains this construction
as :fierine potest ut, etc„ and it is clear that there must be an ellipse of
something of the sort. Cf. 618, where the interrogative —ne is
omitted.

264. quorsum accidat, ‘ what will be the end’ of this hesitation. Cf.
1 27, 176. Mysis is afraid that the ‘ hesitation’ of Pamphilus will end in
the desertion of Glycerium. Some alter incertum to incertumst to avoid
the hiatus, which, however, is sufficiently accounted for by the isolated
position of incertum. It is a further question, whether the hiatus should
be admitted between timeo and incertum or incertum and laec. We follow
Klotz in preferring the latter.

265. peropus, ἅπαξ λεγ. Terence has a large number of adjectives
and adverbs compounded with per.

ipsa, Glycerium.

advorsum hunc--coram lzoc. In 42 advorsum te=tib22

·266. paulo momento, ⁶ by a slight impulse.' Paulus is used as an
adjective by Terence here and Adel. 876. In later Latin we find the

· neut. paulum and the comparative adv. paulo.

267. Pamphile. Cf. 2 3 dicere and note.

268. dolore, pains of child-birth; in this sense usually plural.

269. nuptiae, of Pamphilus with the daughter of Chremes.

272—3. ‘who trusted me with her heart‚ even with her life, while I
have made her the darling of my heart‚ and loved her with a husband's
love.' The change from indicative to subjunctive is noticeable‚ but gives
no difficulty: quae—credidit merely states the fact3 quam—habuerim·
states the reason on account of which Pamphilus thought it impossible
to desert her. Terence might have written otherwise, i. e. crediderit-
habui, or two indicatives or two subjunctives. In a case like this a
change of mood merely indicates a change in the point of view from
which the speaker regards the proposition. If, as herc, that change in
the point of view is intelligible, the grammatical explanation is equally
simple. For a mixture of moods cf. 536, 650, notes.

274. bene et pudice doctum atque eductum, ‘taught and trained
in virtue and purity.'

275. ingenium, ⁶ character.’

277. sed. vim ut] queas ferre, ‘ but (I sear) that you may be unable
to resist compulsion.’

279, 280. The substantives in 280 answer to the adjectives in 279 with
the order inverted. If a man is not ferus, he is influenced by consuetudo
